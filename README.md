# App to convert JSON into CSV and download the CSV file

Just to practice Javascript and React without Redux.

The user can past JSON code in the first textarea, and if the JSON pasted is valid, the CSV code appears in the second textarea.  
Then, a download button allows the user to download the `.csv` file.
